<p>When we initiated a study of the herpetofauna at Santa Cecilia
in Amazonian Ecuador in 1966, we were immediately confronted
with many kinds of animals that we could not identify with the existing
literature. Comparisons of our specimens with those preserved
in other museums resolved some of the problems, but many
identifications could be made only after study of type specimens;
even then some determinations remained questionable. We now
find that in order to prepare a meaningful account of the herpetofauna
of Santa Cecilia, we must complete several taxonomic studies,
the limits of which extend far beyond eastern Ecuador. Because of
our interests in hylids we have begun our studies on these frogs.</p>

<p>One of us (Trueb, 1970a) studied the cranial osteology of
casque-headed hylid frogs and redefined the genus Osteocephalus
but did not determine the number of species in the genus. Our work
in Amazonian Ecuador resulted in the discovery of the sympatric
occurrence of three species at each of two localities; one of these
species was found with a fourth species at another locality. Study
of museum specimens confirmed the recognition of these four species
in the Amazon Basin and lower Amazonian slopes of the Andes.
A fifth species from Bolivia and Perú also is included in the genus.
Examination of museum specimens has provided data on the geographic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
variation in, and distribution of, the five species. However,
our conclusions pertaining to some populations need substantiation,
because we have been hampered by inadequate material from areas
beyond Ecuador. More than half of the 905 specimens of <i>Osteocephalus</i>
are from Ecuador, a relatively small part of the total range
of the genus.</p>

<p>In this paper we are presenting a taxonomic review of the genus
<i>Osteocephalus</i>; of necessity our study has been at the alpha level.
We have utilized all of the usual external characters, as well as
osteological features in our definitions of the species. Tadpoles and
mating calls are available for only one species, <i>O. verrucigerus</i>
(Trueb and Duellman, 1970); these and other important systematic
characters, such as karyotypes, are not available for the group at
this time. Our tendency has been to take a conservative view of
species; thus it is doubtful that any subsequent worker will recognize
fewer species in the genus. Our observations on these frogs in
Amazonian Ecuador are presented in a final section of this paper.</p>

<br />

<div class="caption2">MATERIALS AND METHODS</div>

<p>We have examined 893 preserved frogs, including the type specimens of
all included nominal taxa, 8 skeletons, 1 lot of eggs, and 3 lots of
tadpoles that we refer to the genus <i>Osteocephalus</i>; in addition skulls
were removed from five preserved specimens, and radiographs were made of
12 other preserved specimens. We have been fortunate in seeing living
individuals of all species, except <i>O. pearsoni</i>, but we have colored
photographs of a living specimen of that species. Figures
<a href="#Fig_1">1</a> and <a href="#Fig_2">2</a> were
drawn from projected colored transparencies of living frogs. Terminology
follows that of Duellman (1970b). On the distribution maps solid symbols
indicate localities from which we have examined specimens; open symbols
represent additional locality records based on the literature.
Throughout the text specimens are listed by their catalogue numbers
preceded by the appropriate museum abbreviation, as follows:</p>

<div class="caption2">HISTORICAL RESUMÉ</div>

<p>Because of the taxonomic confusion that has surrounded the
generic name <i>Osteocephalus</i> and two of the species (and their
synonyms), we present a brief resumé of the taxonomic history of
the group.</p>

<p>Among the amphibians sent to the Muséum National d'Histoire
Naturelle in Paris by a Monsieur Leprieur in French Guiana was a
single female specimen of a moderately large hylid having a well-ossified
skull and smooth dorsal skin. This specimen escaped from
the covetous eyes of Johann Tschudi, who prematurely named several
species on the basis of specimens in Paris, and survived without
an epithet until Duméril and Bibron (1841) proposed for it the
name <i>Hyla leprieurii</i>. The description of the species is fairly detailed,
but the specimen was not illustrated. This is the earliest
trivial name now associated with <i>Osteocephalus</i>.</p>

<p>Fitzinger (1843) in his generic synopsis of amphibians and reptiles
proposed the generic name <i>Osteocephalus</i> but did not associate
a specific name with the genus. Consequently, <i>Osteocephalus</i>
Fitzinger, 1843, is a <i>nomen nudum</i>. Franz Steindachner followed
Leopoldo Fitzinger at the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna,
where he had access to Fitzinger's notes and, of course, the important
collections housed in that museum. Steindachner (1862)
named two species of <i>Osteocephalus</i> on the basis of Brasilian
specimens collected by Johann Natterer. Both species were named
in the same publication; <i>O. taurinus</i> appeared on page 77, and
<i>O. favolineatus</i>, on p. 80. This is the earliest association of the
generic name <i>Osteocephalus</i> with a specific name and a description,
both of which satisfy the Code of Zoological Nomenclature for
generic availability. Therefore, Steindachner is the authority for
the generic name <i>Osteocephalus</i>, which has <i>O. taurinus</i> as the type
species by original designation. It is not possible to determine
whether or not Steindachner's usage of <i>Osteocephalus</i> was the same
as that intended by Fitzinger 19 years earlier.</p>

<p>Steindachner (1862) gave reasonably good descriptions of his
two new species and provided excellent illustrations of the two
specimens, both large females. Apparently impressed by the similarities
between <i>Trachycephalus nigromaculatus</i> Tschudi, 1838, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<i>Osteocephalus taurinus</i>, Steindachner (1867) used the combination
<i>Trachycephalus (Osteocephalus) taurinus</i>. This ambiguous usage
for the 1860's precludes our determining if Steindachner was in
effect synonymizing <i>Osteocephalus</i> with <i>Trachycephalus</i> or whether
he was placing <i>Osteocephalus</i> in a subgeneric status. Steindachner
(1867) did not mention <i>O. flavolineatus</i>; perhaps by that time he
had concluded that <i>flavolineatus</i> was only a color morph of <i>taurinus</i>.</p>

<p>Cope (1867) placed <i>Hyla leprieurii</i> in the genus <i>Hypsiboas</i>
Wagler, 1830. Cope (1874) named <i>Osteocephalus planiceps</i> from
Nauta, Perú. The single specimen was among the collections made
by the Orton Expedition to the upper Amazon Basin and was deposited
in the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Boulenger (1882) placed both <i>Osteocephalus</i> and <i>Trachycephalus</i>
<ins title='Correction: was "is"'>in</ins> the synonymy of <i>Hyla</i>; he recognized <i>Hyla taurina</i> (with
<i>O. flavolineatus</i> as a synonym), <i>H. leprieurii</i>, and <i>H. planiceps</i>. In
the same publication Boulenger named <i>Hyla buckleyi</i> on the basis
of 10 specimens in the British Museum from Ecuador; in the description
he stated that <i>buckleyi</i> was like <i>leprieurii</i> and <i>taurinus</i> in having
paired lateral vocal sacs. Boulenger held a lasting influence on
taxonomic herpetology, and his generic synonymy of <i>Osteocephalus</i>
was unchallenged until only a decade ago.</p>

<p>Goin (1961) presented a generic synopsis of the genera of hylid
frogs, in which he recognized <i>Osteocephalus</i> and stated: "There are
perhaps eight or ten species of this genus in South America. Certainly
<i>taurinus</i>, <i>britti</i>, <i>leprieuri</i>, <i>buckleyi</i> and <i>pearsoni</i> belong here.
<i>O. planiceps</i> is surely a synonym of <i>leprieuri</i> and I believe that
<i>garbei</i> is as well. The status of such forms as <i>macrotis</i>, <i>riopastazae</i>,
and <i>depressa</i> has not yet been settled." Goin defined <i>Osteocephalus</i>
as follows: "Males with paired vocal pouches, one at each angle of
the jaw; derm of head not co-ossified with skull but roof of skull
exostosed." Trueb (1970a) elaborated on Goin's definition and
assuredly included only <i>O. taurinus</i> and <i>O. leprieurii</i> in the genus.</p>

<p>Goin's inclusion of <i><ins title='Correction: was "buckley"'>buckleyi</ins></i>, <i>britti</i>, and <i>pearsoni</i> in <i>Osteocephalus</i>
was the first association of any of these names with that genus.
Duellman (1970a) demonstrated that <i>Garbeana garbei</i> Miranda-Ribeiro,
1926, was a member of the <i>Hyla rubra</i> group. <i>Hyla
macrotis</i> Andersson, 1945, is a <i>Phrynohyas</i>. Trueb and Duellman
(1970) determined that <i>Hyla verrucigera</i> Werner, 1901, is the
earliest name for an <i>Osteocephalus</i> displaying striking sexual dimorphism
in coloration and texture of the dorsal skin; <i>Hyla
riopastazae</i> Andersson, 1945 (female holotype), and <i>Hyla orcesi</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Funkhouser, 1956 (male holotype), were placed in the synonymy of
<i>Osteocephalus verrucigerus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hyla pearsoni</i> Gaige, 1929, is a small species of <i>Osteocephalus</i>.
Our findings substantiate Goin's suggestions relative to two other
taxa. <i>Hyla leprieurii britti</i> Melin, 1941, from the Rio Uaupés, Brasil,
and <i>Hyla depressa</i> Andersson, 1945, from the Río Pastaza watershed,
Ecuador, are members of the genus <i>Osteocephalus</i>, but both are
synonyms of earlier names&mdash;<i>leprieurii</i> and <i>taurinus</i>, respectively.
Another name proposed by Melin (1941), <i>Hyla (Trachycephalus)
vilarsi</i> from Taracuá, Brasil, also is placed in the synonymy of
<i>O. taurinus</i>.</p>

<p>Cochran and Goin (1970) were unaware of the identities of <i>Hyla
verrucigera</i> and <i>riopastazae</i>; they used the later name <i>Osteocephalus
orcesi</i> for Colombian frogs that are correctly referred to <i>O. verrucigerus</i>.
Although Goin (1961) placed <i>Hyla buckleyi</i> and <i>H.
pearsoni</i> in <i>Osteocephalus</i>, Cochran and Goin (1970) recognized a
"<i>buckleyi</i> group" in <i>Hyla</i> that included these two species plus a new
species, <i>Hyla cabrerai</i> from Amazonian Colombia and Brasil (total
of three specimens). Also, these authors named <i>Hyla carri</i> from a
single Colombian specimen. Study of the types of <i>Hyla cabrerai</i>,
<i>H. carri</i>, and <i>H. festae</i> Peracca, 1904, from Ecuador, reveal that all
of these names are synonyms of <i>Osteocephalus buckleyi</i>.</p>

<p>Much of the taxonomic confusion and multiplicity of trivial
names is due to the great amount of color variation in <i>taurinus</i> and
to the sexual dimorphism in the texture of the dorsal skin in all of
the species. The details of variation in these and other characters
and our justifications for the synonymies are given in the accounts
of the species. All of the trivial names that apply to species herein
recognized as members of the genus <i>Osteocephalus</i> are listed in

<p><i>Content.</i>&mdash;As defined here, the genus contains five known
species: <i>O. buckleyi</i> (Boulenger), <i>O. leprieurii</i> (Duméril and
Bibron), <i>O. pearsoni</i> (Gaige), <i>O. taurinus</i> Steindachner, and <i>O.
verrucigerus</i> (Werner).</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;The Guianas and Amazon Basin; also in the upper
Orinoco and Magdalena drainages. Most localities are at elevations
below 500 m, but the genus ascends the Amazonian slopes of the
Andes to elevations of about 1800 m.</p>


<div class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Analysis of Characters</span></div>

<p><i>Size and Proportions.</i>&mdash;Frogs of the genus <i>Osteocephalus</i> are
moderate to large hylids. The largest species is <i>taurinus</i>, attaining
a snout-vent length of 103.1 mm; the smallest is <i>pearsoni</i>, which attains
a length of 54.7 mm. Considerable intraspecific geographic variation occurs
in adult size, especially in <i>taurinus</i>. Females of all
species attain a noticeably larger size than males, but no significant
differences are apparent in proportions (<a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>).</p>

<p><i>Coloration.</i>&mdash;All <i>Osteocephalus</i> are predominantly brown frogs
usually with some darker dorsal markings (Figs. 1 and 2). <i>Osteocephalus
verrucigerus</i> has a nearly uniform dark brown dorsum and
no distinct transverse bars on the limbs, whereas all of the other
species have distinct bars on the limbs. The dorsal markings on the
body consist of irregular blotches in <i>buckleyi</i>, <i>pearsoni</i>, and <i>taurinus</i>
but are narrow transverse marks in <i>leprieurii</i>. A narrow middorsal
cream or yellow stripe is present in some individuals of <i>buckleyi</i>
and <i>taurinus</i> but absent in all individuals of the other species. The
flanks are uniform pale tan in <i>leprieurii</i> and uniform reddish brown
in <i>verrucigerus</i>; in the other species the flanks are cream to brown
with dark brown or black spots (also dark diagonal marks in some
<i>buckleyi</i>). A creamy white anal stripe is present in some specimens
of <i>leprieurii</i> but absent in all individuals of other species.</p>

<p>The postocular region, encompassing the tympanum, is dark
brown in most specimens. In adults of <i>pearsoni</i> and <i>taurinus</i> the
upper lips are dark brown. A pale cream or tan suborbital spot is
present in <i>pearsoni</i> and in some <i>taurinus</i>; in some specimens of
<i>taurinus</i> the suborbital spot is expanded posteriorly forming a labial
stripe on the posterior part of the lip. The labial markings of
<i>verrucigerus</i> are similar to the latter pattern, except that in females
a distinct, light labial stripe extends the length of the lip. <i>Osteocephalus
leprieurii</i> has a distinct, broad, pale labial stripe. The lips
are barred cream and dark brown in <i>buckleyi</i>.</p>

<p>The venter is uniform creamy white or pale tan in <i>leprieurii</i>,
uniform white in some <i>buckleyi</i> (most males), and uniform tan in
some <i>taurinus</i>. The other species and some individuals of <i>taurinus</i>
and <i>buckleyi</i> (most females) have dark ventral markings. These
markings are most distinctive in <i>verrucigerus</i>, in which the venter
is white with bold black mottling and spots (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig.&#160;3c</a>). Those individuals
of <i>taurinus</i> having ventral markings usually have indistinct,
diffuse brown spots on the throat and chest (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig.&#160;3b</a>). <i>Osteocephalus
pearsoni</i> is characterized by a fine brown reticulation on the
venter and on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs in
adults (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig.&#160;3a</a>). Individuals of <i>buckleyi</i> that have ventral markings
vary between the patterns illustrated for <i>pearsoni</i> and <i>taurinus</i>
(<a href="#Fig_3">Figs. 3b and c</a>).</p>

<p>Ontogenetic change in coloration is slight or non-existent in
<i>buckleyi</i>, <i>pearsoni</i>, and <i>taurinus</i>, except that juveniles lack ventral
markings. A dark blotch on the back and distinct transverse bars on
the limbs are evident in juveniles of <i>verrucigerus</i>; these markings
are obscured in the adults. Juveniles of <i>leprieurii</i> are olive-brown
with yellow dorsolateral stripes; the transverse dark marks, characteristic
of the adults, appear before the stripes are lost.</p>

<p><i>Skin.</i>&mdash;The dorsal skin of all males of <i>Osteocephalus</i> is tuberculate
to varying degrees, whereas the dorsal skin of females is smooth,
or nearly so (<a href="#Fig_4">Fig.&#160;4</a>). <i>Osteocephalus verrucigerus</i> differs from other
members of the genus by the presence of numerous, large tubercles
bearing keratinized tips. The tubercles of <i>leprieurii</i> are numerous
and spinous but much smaller than those of <i>verrucigerus</i>; those of
<i>taurinus</i> are spinous but less numerous than in <i>leprieurii</i>. <i>Osteocephalus
buckleyi</i> has a mixture of large and small, non-spinous
tubercles, and <i>pearsoni</i> has only a few, small, scattered, non-spinous
tubercles. Fleshy tubercles occur on the eyelids and supratympanic
fold in females of <i>buckleyi</i>; a few small tubercles are present on the
back of females of <i>pearsoni</i>, whereas the dorsal skin in females of
the other species is smooth. The skin on the flanks of both sexes of
<i>buckleyi</i> is weakly areolate; in the other species the flanks are
smooth. The skin on the top of the head in <i>taurinus</i> is rugose as a
consequence of co-ossification. In all species the anal opening is
directed posteriorly at the upper level of the thighs.</p>

<p><i>Hands and Feet.</i>&mdash;The feet of <i>Osteocephalus</i> are fully webbed or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
nearly so. Webbing between fingers one and two is basal in all
species. Webbing between fingers two, three, and four is most extensive
in <i>taurinus</i>, in which the three fingers are about one-half
webbed (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig.&#160;5</a>). <i>Osteocephalus buckleyi</i>, <i>pearsoni</i>, and <i>verrucigerus</i>
have reduced webbing between fingers two and three,
and <i>leprieurii</i> has reduced webbing between fingers two, three, and
four. All members of the genus have well-developed subconical
subarticular tubercles on the fingers and toes; there is a tendency
for the distal tubercle on the fourth finger to be weakly bifid.
Palmar and plantar supernumerary tubercles are well developed in
<i>taurinus</i>, moderately developed in <i>buckleyi</i>, <i>leprieurii</i>, and <i>pearsoni</i>,
and barely evident in <i>verrucigerus</i>. All of the species have a noticeable
fold on the wrist and enlarged prepollices, bearing horny
nuptial excrescences in breeding males. The prepollex is least enlarged
in <i>buckleyi</i>. Outer metatarsal tubercles are absent. The
inner metatarsal tubercle is moderately well developed and ovoid
in <i>leprieurii</i> and <i>pearsoni</i>; it is elliptical and flat in the other species.
Tarsal folds are absent in all species except <i>verrucigerus</i>, in which
the folds are barely evident.</p>

<p><i>Cranium.</i>&mdash;As a genus, the cranial structure is remarkably uniform
and quite generalized when viewed in the context of the family
Hylidae. The skulls are broad and relatively flat, each being only
slightly more broad than long and about one-third as high as long.
In dorsal aspect the snouts are broadly rounded; the snout of
<i>buckleyi</i> is somewhat less rounded and appears to be slightly longer
than the snouts of other species. This subtle difference relates to
the relative narrowness of the premaxillaries in <i>buckleyi</i>.</p>

<p>The genus is characterized by well-developed dermal roofing
bones and an unusually large exposure of the sphenethmoid dorsally
(<a href="#Fig_6">Fig.&#160;6</a>). The conformation of the sphenethmoid exposed dorsally
is determined by the marginal positions of the adjacent, overlapping
elements&mdash;the nasals and frontoparietals. Medially the nasals overlap
the lateral margins of the sphenethmoid. Anteromedially, the
nasals converge in <i>leprieurii</i> and <i>taurinus</i>, are narrowly separated
in <i>buckleyi</i> and <i>pearsoni</i>, or are more widely separated in <i>verrucigerus</i>.
In all species the nasals terminate at the anterodorsal
corner of the orbit. The frontoparietals of <i>buckleyi</i>, <i>leprieurii</i>, and
<i>taurinus</i> have an anterolateral extension, which marginally overlaps
the dorsolateral edge of the sphenethmoid and articulates with the
posterodorsal corner of the nasal in <i>buckleyi</i> and <i>taurinus</i>; the bones
are narrowly separated in <i>leprieurii</i>. The frontoparietals of <i>pearsoni</i>
and <i>verrucigerus</i> have more extensive median ossification and less
extensive anterolateral ossification. Thus, in those species the
posteromedian portion of the sphenethmoid is obscured, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
lateral margins are partly exposed. The frontoparietal fontanelle is
completely covered in all species, except <i>buckleyi</i> and <i>leprieurii</i>, in
which an irregular, median separation of the frontoparietals exposes
a small portion of the fontanelle. The posterolateral margins of the
frontoparietals lie medial to the epiotic eminences.</p>

<p>Dermal ornamentation, involving the nasals, frontoparietals, and
sphenethmoid, occurs in <i>taurinus</i> and, to a limited extent, in <i>pearsoni</i>.
In the latter species marginal portions of the frontoparietals,
the dorsal surfaces of the nasals, and the posteromedial part of the
exposed sphenethmoid are slightly exostosed, resulting in an open,
reticulate pattern of dermal sculpturing of exceedingly low relief
(<a href="#Fig_6">Fig.&#160;6c</a>). <i>Osteocephalus taurinus</i> is characterized by casquing,
co-ossification, and a rather intricate pattern of dermal sculpturing,
which was described in detail and illustrated by Trueb (1970a).</p>

<p>The squamosals of all species are moderately large structures
having otic plates that overlie the lateral portion of the cristae
paroticae. The posterior rami are short; the zygomatic rami of all
species, except <i>taurinus</i>, extend slightly more than one-half of the
distance to the maxillary. In <i>taurinus</i> the zygomatic ramus extends
nearly to, or articulates with, the maxillary.</p>

<p>The maxillary arches are complete and relatively robust. The
alary processes of the premaxillaries are vertically oriented in
<i>leprieurii</i>, <i>pearsoni</i>, and <i>taurinus</i> and very slightly inclined posteriorly
in <i>buckleyi</i> and <i>verrucigerus</i>. The maxillaries are uniformly
characterized by the absence of postorbital processes and by the
presence of preorbital processes that articulate with the maxillary
processes of the nasals. The partes facialae of the maxillaries are
moderately developed in all species, except <i>taurinus</i>, in which the
pars fascialis tends to articulate with the lateral margin of the nasal
in well-ossified individuals. The partes palatinae are poorly developed
in all species, except <i>buckleyi</i>, in which the pars palatina
of the premaxillary is moderately robust.</p>

<p>The pterygoids are uniformly tri-radiate structures. The anterior
rami terminate at about the mid-level of the orbit, and the medial
rami articulate firmly with the anterolateral corner of the otic capsule.
The palatines are well-developed elements bearing ventral
ridges; the ridges are somewhat irregular in <i>buckleyi</i>, <i>taurinus</i>, and
<i>verrucigerus</i> but smooth in <i>leprieurii</i> and <i>pearsoni</i>. The parasphenoids
are large elements characterized by acuminate cultriform
processes and posterolaterally inclined alary processes. The basal
areas of the cultriform processes bear small odontoid protuberances
in <i>buckleyi</i>, <i>taurinus</i>, and <i>verrucigerus</i>, whereas they are smooth in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<i>leprieurii</i> and <i>pearsoni</i>. The prevomers are remarkably uniform,
moderately well-developed structures. In each species the anterior
ramus lies adjacent to the premaxillary, and the lateral wings form
the anterior, medial, and posteromedial margins of the internal
nares. The dentigerous processes are characteristically large and
angular and bear numerous teeth. The sphenethmoid and otoccipitals
are well ossified; a dermal sphenethmoid is present only in
<i>taurinus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Vertebral Column.</i>&mdash;The cervical cotyles are uniformly widely
displaced. The neural arches are low and non-imbricate. The transverse
processes of the third presacral vertebrae are approximately
equal in width to the sacral diapophyses in all species, except <i>buckleyi</i>,
in which the processes of the third presacral are slightly narrower
than the diapophyses. <i>Osteocephalus buckleyi</i> is further distinguished
by the presence of narrow transverse processes on presacrals
five through eight (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig.&#160;7b</a>); males have narrower processes
than do females. The processes are moderately wide but subequal
in width in <i>pearsoni</i>, <i>taurinus</i>, and <i>verrucigerus</i>,
whereas they are nearly equivalent in width to one another and to the sacral
diapophyses in <i>leprieurii</i> (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig.&#160;7a</a>). The
<ins title='Correction: was "scaral"'>sacral</ins> diapophyses of all
species are moderately dilated and posterolaterally inclined. The
coccyx bears a distinct dorsal ridge and has a bicondylar articulation
with the sacrum.</p>

<p><i>Pectoral Girdle.</i>&mdash;The pectoral girdles are fully arciferal and
bear small, cartilaginous omosterna and moderately large cartilaginous
sterna. The coracoids are robust, and the clavicles are
strongly arched. Procoracoid cartilage seems to be absent. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
scapulae are large, longer than the clavicles, and bicapitate proximally.
The suprascapulae are moderately large and well ossified in
<i>leprieurii</i> and <i>taurinus</i>. The suprascapula of <i>verrucigerus</i> is poorly
ossified, and that of <i>buckleyi</i> is not ossified.</p>

<p><i>Pelvic Girdle.</i>&mdash;The ilia of <i>buckleyi</i>, <i>taurinus</i>, and <i>verrucigerus</i>
lack any indication of a crest on the shaft, whereas <i>leprieurii</i> has a
low crest. The dorsal acetabular expansion of the ilia is moderately
low in <i>taurinus</i> and <i>verrucigerus</i>, but distinctly lower in <i>buckleyi</i>
and <i>leprieurii</i>. The ilia of all species bear low dorsal protuberances.
The ischia of <i>leprieurii</i>, <i>taurinus</i>, and <i>verrucigerus</i> are moderately
expanded; that of <i>buckleyi</i> is somewhat less expanded dorsally. The
pubis of <i>leprieurii</i>, <i>taurinus</i>, and <i>verrucigerus</i> are calcified, whereas
that of <i>buckleyi</i> remains cartilaginous.</p>

<p><i>Throat Musculature and Vocal Sac Structure.</i>&mdash;Tyler (1971) described
the throat myology of <i>Osteocephalus</i>. The genus is characterized
by a moderate-sized araphic submentalis muscle and an undifferentiated
intermandibularis having an elongate median aponeurosis.
The intermandibularis and submentalis are completely independent
in <i>buckleyi</i>, whereas in the other species there is a small
attachment between these muscles.</p>

<p>According to Tyler (pers. com.), <i>Osteocephalus</i> has three distinctive
types of vocal sac structure which result from differences in
the development of the interhyoideus muscle and the overlying skin.
In <i>leprieurii</i> and <i>verrucigerus</i> the supramandibular portions of the
interhyoideus form a simple tubular, posterolateral extension; there
is no modification of the associated skin. <i>Osteocephalus buckleyi</i>
and <i>pearsoni</i> have more extensive development of the supramandibular
portions of the interhyoideus; furthermore, the associated skin
forms a broad, loose fold extending from the ventromedial surface
of the throat dorsolaterally to the base of the supratympanic fold.
Like <i>buckleyi</i> and <i>pearsoni</i>, the supramandibular portion of the interhyoideus
is much expanded in <i>taurinus</i>. The vocal sac structure
of <i>taurinus</i> differs from that of other members of the genus in that
the skin of <i>taurinus</i> forms an everted pouch, which dangles loosely
beneath the supratympanic fold.</p>

<p><i>Justification of Synonymy.</i>&mdash;Boulenger (1882:362) listed 11 specimens
in his description of <i>Hyla buckleyi</i>. We have examined all of
these and conclude that one (BMNH 1947.2.13.42) is <i>O. leprieurii</i>.
Cochran and Goin (1970:213) restricted the type locality to
Canelos, <ins title='Correction: was "Provicia"'>Provincia</ins> Pastaza, Ecuador; we here select BMNH 1947.2.13.44
from that locality as the lectotype. This specimen is a male
having a snout-vent length of 37.9 mm; the diameter of the tympanum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
is 3.5 mm, 81.4 percent of the diameter of the eye. The type
series, exclusive of BMNH 1947.2.13.42 (= <i>O. leprieurii</i>) consists of
six males having snout-vent lengths of 37.9-44.6 (mean 40.4) mm,
and four females having snout-vent lengths of 50.0-53.9 (mean 51.5)
mm. The dorsum in the males bears a mixture of large and small
tubercles, whereas the dorsum in females is nearly smooth. The
skin on the flanks, especially the axilla, is areolate. The coloration
consists of a creamy tan ground color with irregular reddish brown
markings on the back and broad transverse bars on the limbs. The
dorsal markings are narrowly bordered by creamy white; those on
the back consist of an interorbital bar and a pair of longitudinal
marks beginning in the scapular region and usually diverging posteriorly
in the sacral region or converging into a broad median
blotch. One specimen has a middorsal creamy white stripe from
the tip of the snout to the vent. In all of the types large dark brown
spots are present on the flanks and posterior surfaces of the thighs.
The ventral surfaces are pale creamy tan with or without diffuse
brown spots on the throat and chest.</p>

<p>The holotype of <i>Hyla festae</i> is a female having a snout-vent
length of 75.0 mm; the diameter of the tympanum is 3.9 mm, 57.4
percent of the diameter of the eye. The skin is smooth on the
dorsum and areolate on the anterior part of the flanks. The dorsum
is pale brown with a large median longitudinal dark brown blotch
on the back and broad transverse bars, narrowly outlined by cream,
on the limbs. Dark brown spots are present on the flanks; the posterior
surfaces of the thighs are dark brown. The throat and belly
are grayish white with irregular dark brown spots.</p>

<p>The holotype of <i>Hyla carri</i> is a female having a snout-vent
length of 66.1 mm; the diameter of the tympanum is 4.7 mm, 81.0
percent of the diameter of the eye. The skin on the dorsum is
smooth with scattered small tubercles and areolate on the anterior
part of the flanks. The dorsum is tan with irregular dark brown
blotches on the back and transverse bars on the limbs; all dorsal
markings are narrowly outlined by creamy white. Dark brown
spots are present on the flanks; the venter and posterior surfaces of
the thighs are tan without dark spots.</p>

<p>The holotype of <i>Hyla cabrerai</i> is a female having a snout-vent
length of 52.7 mm; the diameter of the tympanum is 4.0 mm, 76.9
percent of the diameter of the eye. The skin on the dorsum is weakly
tuberculate and that on the anterior part of the flanks is areolate.
The dorsum is creamy tan with dark brown markings (interorbital
bar, reticulations on occiput, three longitudinal streaks on back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and broad transverse bars on limbs). Irregular dark brown spots
are present on the flanks. The venter is pinkish tan with small
reddish brown spots on the throat and darker brown spots on the
chest and belly.</p>

<p>In their description of <i>Hyla cabrerai</i>, Cochran and Goin (1970:217)
stated: "This species, together with <i>buckleyi</i> and <i>pearsoni</i>
certainly make a closely knit group&#2026;. Both <i>buckleyi</i> and <i>cabrerai</i>
have long hind legs, with the extended heel reaching to the tip of
the snout, while in <i>pearsoni</i> the extended heel reaches only to the
eye. <i>H. buckleyi</i> has the belly dusky, while it is heavily spotted in
<i>cabrerai</i> and is reticulated in <i>pearsoni</i>. <i>H. cabrerai</i> seems to have
the heaviest hands with the most webbing between the fingers; the
other two species have the webbing reduced between the fingers."
The description of <i>Hyla cabrerai</i> was based on three specimens.
We have examined the holotype and one paratype (WCAB 13284
from Territorio do Amapá, Brasil). Another paratype in the private
collection of C. J. Goin from Caño Tuí, between Mitú and Raudal
de Yurupari, Comisaria de Vaupés, Colombia, was not examined.</p>

<p>Cochran and Goin (1970:211) based their description of <i>Hyla
carri</i> on one gravid female and stated: "A large <i>Hyla</i> with the
vomerine teeth in two &#652;&#652; shaped patches between the somewhat
squarish choanae; reduced webs between the fingers; and a pattern
of dorsal dark blotches bordered by light margins. The species is
not similar to any other species known in Colombia. It is perhaps
most closely related to <i>Hyla claresignata</i> of Brazil, from which it
can be differentiated by its more heavily spotted dorsum, larger
tympanum, and lack of dark anal spots."</p>

<p>Except for the inclusion of the name in checklists, <i>Hyla festae</i>
has not been mentioned in the literature since the original description.</p>

<p>The wholesale synonymization of names, which, on the bases of
their published diagnoses, seem to apply to distinctly different
species, is possible with the application of uniform criteria to the
types and series of other specimens. In measurements and proportions
the type specimens of the nominal taxa all fall within the
range of variation exhibited by a series of 18 males and 15 females
from Provincia Pastaza, Ecuador, except the ratio of the diameter
of the tympanum to that of the eye in the female holotype of <i>Hyla
festae</i>. In that specimen the ratio is 0.574, whereas the ratio in the
15 females from Provincia Pastaza is 0.587-0.905 (mean 0.736).</p>

<p>Ventral coloration is the most variable character among the
types. The venter in the type of <i>Hyla festae</i> is boldly spotted; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
distinctly spotted in <i>cabrerai</i>, uniform tan in <i>carri</i>, and tan, flecked,
or spotted in the type series of <i>buckleyi</i>. The ventral coloration in
series of specimens from Amazonian Ecuador encompasses that observed
in all of the types, except that of <i>festae</i>, which has more
ventral spotting than any other individual.</p>

<p>The webbing on the hand usually excludes the penultimate
phalanges of the fingers, but in some specimens from Amazonian
Ecuador the webbing encompasses the proximal parts of the penultimate
phalanges of the fingers. In a few of these specimens, the
holotype of <i>festae</i>, and one paratype of <i>cabrerai</i> the webbing extends
to the middle of the penultimate phalanges of the third and
fourth fingers. In the holotype of <i>cabrerai</i> the webbing extends to
the middle of the penultimate phalanges of the third and fourth
fingers and to the base of the disc of the second finger.</p>

<p>The types of the nominal taxa and series of specimens from
Guyana and Amazonian Ecuador display noticeable variation in
dorsal coloration. The variety of dorsal patterns of all of the types
is included in the variation displayed by the other specimens. All
specimens have some amount of dark spotting on the flanks; all have
vertically barred lips, on which a pale subocular spot usually is evident.
Probably the most unifying physical characteristic of all of
the specimens is the nature of the skin on the anterior part of the
flank. The skin is elevated amidst an irregular network of depressions.
This areolate dermal condition is present in all specimens
and does not occur in other species of <i>Osteocephalus</i>. The degree of
tubercularity of the skin on the dorsum is variable and sexually
dimorphic. All males are tubercular, whereas small females are
smooth or have only a few scattered tubercles. Large females
usually have pronounced tubercles on the eyelids and supratympanic
fold.</p>

<p>In their description of <i>Hyla carri</i>, Cochran and Goin (1970:211)
misrepresented the nature of the dentigerous processes of the prevomers,
which are angular, not &#652;-shaped. Their suggestion that the
Colombian <i>Hyla carri</i> is related to <i>Hyla claresignata</i> in southeastern
Brasil is unfounded. The latter species is smaller (40 mm), has a
yellow dorsum and venter, dark brown spots dorsolaterally, oblique
dentigerous processes of the prevomers, small tympanum, and
smooth skin dorsally.</p>

<p>The ventral coloration of the type of <i>Hyla festae</i> resembles that
of <i>Osteocephalus verrucigerus</i>, but the type differs from <i>verrucigerus</i>
by having areolate skin on the flanks and distinct dark markings
on the dorsum. In <i>verrucigerus</i> the skin on the flanks is smooth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and the dorsum is uniform dark brown, except for a tan snout in
females.</p>

<p>Comparisons of the types of the nominal species with series of
specimens from Guyana, Colombia, Ecuador, and Perú suggest
strongly that the types are representative of one taxon, the oldest
name for which is <i>Hyla buckleyi</i> Boulenger, 1882. Consequently,
we place <i>Hyla festae</i> Peracca, 1904, <i>Hyla carri</i> Cochran and Goin,
1970, and <i>Hyla cabrerai</i> Cochran and Goin, 1970, as junior synonyms
of <i>Hyla buckleyi</i> Boulenger, 1882.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;1)&#160;Size moderate, sexual dimorphism extreme; maximum
observed snout-vent length in males 48.1 mm, in females 75.1
mm; 2)&#160;skin on dorsum in males bearing a mixture of large and
small non-spinous tubercles; 3)&#160;skin on flanks, especially anteriorly,
areolate; 4)&#160;web usually extending only to base of antepenultimate
phalange on inner edge of third finger; 5)&#160;dorsum pale tan or green
with irregular, longitudinal, dark brown blotches, usually narrowly
outlined with cream; 6)&#160;venter cream or tan, suffused with brown
or marked with brown spots in some specimens; 7)&#160;lips marked with
vertical brown and cream bars; 8)&#160;flanks creamy tan with irregular
brown spots and/or diagonal marks; 9)&#160;dermal roofing bones of
skull lacking exostosis; 10)&#160;dermal sphenethmoid absent; 11)&#160;nasals
widely separated medially; 12)&#160;anteromedial margin of frontoparietal
at mid-level of orbit; 13)&#160;frontoparietal fontanelle partially exposed;
14)&#160;palatine serrate; 15)&#160;parasphenoid bearing odontoids;
16)&#160;zygomatic ramus of squamosal extending approximately one-half
of distance to maxillary arch; 17)&#160;transverse processes of third
presacral vertebra narrower than sacral diapophyses; transverse
processes of presacral vertebrae 3-8 subequal in width and narrower
in males than in females; 18)&#160;intermandibularis and submentalis
muscles independent; 19)&#160;supramandibular portion of interhyoideus
extensively developed; associated skin forming broad
loose fold.</p>

<p><i>Osteocephalus buckleyi</i> can be distinguished readily from all
other species in the genus by the presence of areolate skin anteriorly
on the flanks and by the rather boldly contrasting dorsal pattern.
Furthermore, females are distinctive in having tubercles on the
eyelids and supratympanic folds.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;The periphery of the Amazon Basin, in the Guianas
and Territorio do Amapá in northeastern Brasil; the upper
Amazon Basin from southern Colombia to east-central Bolivia; one
locality (Acevedo) in upper Río Magdalena drainage in Colombia
(<a href="#Fig_8">Fig.&#160;8</a>). All localities are at elevations of less than 700 m. Records
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
for Pallatanga and Santiago in Provincia Chimborazo, Ecuador
(high on the Pacific slopes of the Andes), are considered to be

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In life the dorsum is green with dark markings. A
male (KU 123171) from Santa Cecilia, Ecuador, was: "Dorsum
green with dark brown blotches. Anterior and posterior surfaces of
thighs dull blue. Venter brown, flecked with white. Iris greenish
bronze with brown horizontal triangles and ventromedian brown
line." (W. E. Duellman, field notes, 16 June 1968.) A female (KU
126646) from Lago Agrio, Ecuador, was: "Dorsum pale green with
darker green blotches and creamy yellow middorsal stripe. Lateral
blotches bronze-tan. Flanks tan with black blotches. Anterior surfaces
of thighs dark brown. Dorsal and posterior surfaces of thighs
and shanks tan with dark brown blotches. Webbing brown. Suborbital
spot green. Postorbital bar black. Belly grayish brown in
appearance&mdash;tips of granules white; intergranular spaces brown.
Iris golden bronze with black flecks peripherally and median, horizontal,

<p><i>Justification of Synonymy.</i>&mdash;The holotype of <i>Hyla leprieurii</i> is a
female having a snout-vent length of 46.6 mm. The diameter of the
tympanum is 3.7 mm, 69.8 percent of the diameter of the eye. The
dorsal roofing bones are smooth, and the skin on the dorsum is
smooth. The penultimate phalanges of the fingers are not included
in the webbing. When we examined the specimen on 2 July 1969,
it was slightly soft and somewhat faded to a peculiar grayish green
color with faint darker transverse bars on the limbs. Duméril and
Bibron (1841:554) described the coloration, as follows: "The loreal
region <ins title='Correction: was "in"'>is</ins> black. A stripe of the same color extends from the posterior
border of the orbit to the corner of the mouth, passing through the
tympanum. All of the dorsal parts are grayish white with large
transverse brown bands, which are more expanded and less regularly
outlined on the back than on the limbs. There is one of these
on the occiput that is in a triangular shape. All of the venter is
white." (Free translation from French.)</p>

<p>The holotype of <i>Hyla leprieurii britti</i> is a male having a snout-vent
length of 48.1 mm. The diameter of the tympanum is 3.6 mm,
65.5 percent of the diameter of the eye. The skin on the dorsum is
tubercular; the tubercles are small on head and on the dorsal surfaces
of the limbs and slightly larger on the back. The penultimate
phalanges of the fingers are not included in the webbing. Melin
(1941:43) stated: "Above blackish brown with a very indistinct
band between the eyes; iris with mottle of
<ins title='Correction: was "metalic"'>metallic</ins> lustre; hinder
parts of upper jaw whitish; sides of body mottled with blackish
brown; hind limbs (especially tibiae and tarsi) with narrow, diffuse
cross bars; beneath whitish with slight brown mottle along jaw."
We examined the type on 17 February 1969; at that time it was
dull brown above with faint, narrow, dark brown, transverse bars on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the back and dorsal surfaces of the limbs. A cream subocular spot
was evident, and the venter was creamy white.</p>

<p>Melin (1941:42) stated that the holotype of <i>Hyla leprieurii britti</i>
"&#2026; resembles a good deal <i>H. leprieurii</i> Dum. &amp; Bibr. As, however,
it differs from the latter species by its very concave loreal region,
small tympanum, and almost uniformly brownish colour, it may at
least form a subspecies of <i>leprieurii</i>&#2026;." The pattern of narrow
transverse bars on the backs of the holotypes of <i>H. leprieurii</i> and
<i>H. britti</i> is a condition shared only by these two nominal taxa that
are placed in <i>Osteocephalus</i>. Melin noted that <i>britti</i> differed from
<i>leprieurii</i> in the depth of the loreal concavity and in the size of the
tympanum. Neither of these differences is noteworthy in comparison
with series of specimens. The depth of the loreal concavity is a
highly subjective character, and we note no differences between the
types. The ratio of the diameter of the tympanum to the diameter of
the eye is relatively smaller in both holotypes (0.698 in <i>leprieurii</i>&mdash;&#9792;;
0.655 in <i>britti</i>&mdash;&#9794;) than in series of fresh specimens from Lago
Agrio, Ecuador (0.652-0.884, mean 0.785 in 17 males; 0.700-0.909,
mean 0.790 in 20 females). The smaller proportions in the types may
be due to geographic variation or to shrinkage as a result of many
years in preservative (130+ years for <i>leprieurii</i>; 45 for <i>britti</i>).</p>

<p>Comparisons of the holotypes with series of specimens from
Ecuador, Guyana, and Surinam indicate that one morphological
species occurs throughout the upper Amazon Basin and the Guianas
and that both type specimens are representatives of one species.
Consequently, we consider <i>Hyla leprieurii</i> Duméril and Bibron,
1841, to be a monotypic species with <i>Hyla leprieurii britti</i> Melin,
1941, as a junior synonym.</p>

<p>In their account of <i>Osteocephalus leprieurii</i>, Cochran and Goin
(1970:323) stated: "The specimen described and illustrated (MCZ
28042) has been directly compared with the types of <i>leprieurii</i>,
<i>planiceps</i>, and <i>vilarsi</i> by the junior author and there seems to be no
doubt that all are conspecific. Another specimen (CNHM 69716)
has been directly compared with the types of <i>planiceps</i> and <i>vilarsi</i>
and these, likewise, are considered conspecific." With this justification
Cochran and Goin (1970:322) included <i>Osteocephalus planiceps</i>
Cope, 1874, and <i>Hyla vilarsi</i> Melin, 1941, in the synonymy of
<i>Osteocephalus leprieurii</i>.</p>

<p>We do not concur with Cochran and Goin's synonymy and contend
that <i>planiceps</i> and <i>vilarsi</i> are synonyms of <i>Osteocephalus
taurinus</i>; we give our reasons in the account of that species. We
have examined the specimens listed as <i>O. leprieurii</i> by Cochran and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Goin; several of them, including CNHM (= FMNH) 69716, are
<i>taurinus</i>. Thus, due to Cochran and Goin's confusion of two taxa,
their comparisons of certain specimens with types has little meaning.</p>

<p>Cochran and Goin did not include <i>Hyla leprieurii britti</i> in their
synonymy of <i>Osteocephalus leprieurii</i> but did discuss the name in
their account of <i>Osteocephalus orcesi</i> (= <i>O. verrucigerus</i>), as follows
(1970:319): "When we first examined one of the specimens
we felt sure that we had Melin's <i>Hyla britti</i> at hand, but on direct
comparison with the type of <i>britti</i> the two proved to be different.
After studying the type of <i>orcesi</i> (SUNHM 13150) we have no
doubt that the specimens at hand are <i>orcesi</i> and that <i>britti</i> is a different,
probably valid species."</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;1)&#160;Size moderate, sexual dimorphism evident; maximum
observed snout-vent length in males 48.4 mm, in females, 61.5
mm; 2)&#160;skin on dorsum in males bearing numerous, minute, spinous
tubercles; 3)&#160;skin on flanks smooth; 4)&#160;web extending to base of
antepenultimate phalange on inner edge of third finger; 5)&#160;dorsum
tan or olive-brown with transverse brown or olive bars; 6)&#160;venter
creamy white or pale tan without markings; 7)&#160;lips marked with
creamy tan labial stripe and suborbital spot; 8)&#160;flanks pale tan with

levels of orbit; 13)&#160;frontoparietal fontanelle partially exposed;
14)&#160;palatine not serrate; 15)&#160;parasphenoid lacking odontoids;
16)&#160;zygomatic ramus of squamosal extending about one-half of
distance to maxillary arch; 17)&#160;transverse processes of presacral
vertebrae 3-8 about equal in width to one another and to sacral
diapophyses; 18)&#160;intermandibularis and submentalis muscles connected;
19)&#160;supramandibular portion of interhyoideus forming
simple tubular posterolateral extension; associated skin unmodified.</p>

<p><i>Osteocephalus leprieurii</i> differs from all other members of the
genus by having transverse dark bars on the back. Two other hylids
(<i>Hyla lanciformis</i> and <i>multifasciata</i>) in the Amazon Basin have
transverse dark marks on the dorsum. Both of these differ from
<i>leprieurii</i> by having pointed snouts, much longer hind limbs, and
smooth skin dorsally.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;The periphery of the Amazon Basin, in the Guianas
and the upper part of the basin in southern Colombia, Ecuador,
Perú, and extreme western Brasil (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig.&#160;9</a>). Most localities are at
elevations of less than 500 m, but the species ascends the lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Andean slopes to elevations of 1100 m. 265 specimens from 31

(triangles).</div>
</div>
<br />

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Most adults of <i>leprieurii</i> have distinct transverse
markings on the back; these are variable in width, extent, and arrangement.
In some specimens, such as USNM 166557, some of the
transverse bars are fragmented into spots; in a few specimens the
dorsal pattern consists solely of small dark spots arranged in
transverse rows. Such specimens have a dorsal pattern resembling
that of some <i>taurinus</i>. The transverse nature of the dorsal markings
is further modified in some specimens, such as USNM 166555, in
which the dark bars are fragmented and oblique.</p>

<p>Extreme ontogenetic change in color pattern is exhibited by
this species (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig.&#160;10</a>). Juveniles having snout-vent lengths of less
than 28 mm have an olive-brown dorsum with a pale cream stripe
across the head and broad, cream, dorsolateral stripes; transverse
dark bars are absent on the body and limbs. Individuals having
snout-vent lengths of 30-35 mm have dark brown transverse bars on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the back and limbs but still retain the light dorsolateral stripes,
whereas the stripes are lost in larger individuals.</p>

<p>Coloration in life of specimens from Lago Agrio, Ecuador: "In
males the dorsal ground color varies from dark brown to ochre-tan;
dorsal markings uniformly dark brown. Most specimens have dark
brown and cream anal stripes; labial area cream-colored. Flanks
vary from tan to white. Ventral coloration varies from salmon to
tan to white. The iris is bronze with a greenish cast and black
reticulations. In females the dorsal coloration is the same as in
males, except that dark marks tend to be outlined with cream;
venter tannish salmon." (W. E. Duellman, field notes, 12 May
1969).</p>

<div class="species_ref"><i>Osteocephalus pearsoni</i>&mdash;Goin, 1961:13.</div>

<p><i>Justification of Synonymy.</i>&mdash;Goin (1961:13) suggested that <i>Hyla
pearsoni</i> Gaige was an <i>Osteocephalus</i>, but Cochran and Goin (1970:217)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
considered <i>pearsoni</i> to be a <i>Hyla</i>. The presence of exostosed
dermal roofing bones, angulate prevomerine dentigerous processes,
and the structure of the vocal sacs are characters which place the
species in <i>Osteocephalus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;1)&#160;Size moderate, sexual dimorphism evident; maximum

muscles connected; 19)&#160;supramandibular portion of interhyoideus
extensively developed; associated skin forming broad loose fold.</p>

<p><i>Osteocephalus pearsoni</i> can be distinguished most readily from
other members of the genus by the brown reticulate pattern on the
venter, round brown spots on the flanks, and smooth skin on the
flanks. Also, it is the least tuberculate species in the genus.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Upper Amazon Basin and Amazonian slopes of
the Andes in central Perú (1620 m in Río Ucayali drainage) and
northern Bolivia (less than 500 m in Río Beni drainage) (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig.&#160;8</a>).
6 specimens from 3 localities.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The specimen from Yaupi, Perú (KU 136312) is a
subadult female having a snout-vent length of 39.8 mm. In life the
coloration was: "Dorsum light pinkish brown with large rich
chocolate brown blotch from eyes to anterior tips of ilia; numerous
small chocolate blotches on flanks; dorsal surfaces of thighs and
shanks, canthus, and supraorbital region to insertion of forearm
chocolate brown; supralabial border and short bar from eye to lip
bronze-white; venter bronze-white with numerous tiny chocolate
brown flecks [tending to form reticulations on throat and chest];
anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs light olive-brown; iris
largely black with gold flecks." (Thomas H. Fritts, field notes, 23
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
March 1970.) On the basis of this one subadult, it seems likely that
reticulations on the venter develop with age.</p>

<p><i>Justification of Synonymy.</i>&mdash;The holotype of <i>Osteocephalus
taurinus</i> is a female having a snout-vent length of 103.9 mm. The
diameter of the tympanum is 6.8 mm, 77.3 percent of the diameter of
the eye. The skull is strongly exostosed, and the lateral edges of the
frontoparietals are elevated so as to form distinct ridges. The skin
on the dorsum is smooth. When we examined the type on 5 August
1969, the specimen was soft and badly faded to a pale creamy tan
with pale brown transverse bars on the hind limbs and spots on the
flanks. Steindachner (1862:79) described the coloration of the
type: "In the preserved specimen the dorsum of the entire body,
including fore and hind limbs, is a light yellow-brown color, which
becomes lighter towards the venter. The belly is whitish, as are
the undersides of the arms and legs. The throat is indistinctly
marbled with brown. Roundish dark brown flecks are randomly
distributed in a considerable number along the side of the body up
to the eye; the tympanum is more or less fully surrounded by brown.
A few discrete spots, always more or less drawn out in length, on
the sides of the body, are also found on the posterior part of the
back. The dorsal surfaces of the fore and hind feet are marked
with somewhat obliquely arranged brown transverse bands, which
are more intensively colored near the margin than in the middle of
the band." (free translation from German.)</p>

<p>The holotype of <i>Osteocephalus flavolineatus</i> is a female having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
a snout-vent length of 81.8 mm. The diameter of the tympanum is
6.0 mm, 71.4 percent of the diameter of the eye. The skull is
strongly exostosed, and the lateral edges of the frontoparietals are
elevated so as to form a ridge on each side. The skin on the dorsum
is very weakly tuberculate. We examined the type on 9 August
1969 and found it to be in excellent condition. The color pattern is
unchanged from that described by Steindachner (1862:81). The
dorsum is tan with irregular brown blotches on the back, spots on
the flanks, and transverse bars on the limbs. A narrow creamy white,
middorsal stripe extends from the snout to the vent. The subocular
area is creamy tan, and the venter is tan. Boulenger (1882:363)
questionably synonymized <i>flavolineatus</i> with <i>taurinus</i>. We have
observed that a middorsal cream stripe occurs in about 10 percent
of the specimens of <i>taurinus</i> and in some specimens of <i>buckleyi</i>.
This is a common color morph in many species of <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>.
In the absence of distinguishing morphological characteristics we
can only conclude that the middorsal stripe is a pattern variant and
that Boulenger was correct in synonymizing <i>flavolineatus</i> with
<i>taurinus</i>.</p>

<p>The holotype of <i>Osteocephalus planiceps</i> is a male having a
snout-vent length of 58.5 mm. The diameter of the tympanum is
4.9 mm, 77.8 percent of the diameter of the eye. The skull is
moderately exostosed, and the lateral edges of the frontoparietals
are distinctly elevated. The skin on the dorsum is tuberculate. Cope
(1874:122) described the coloration of the type as follows: "Color
above uniform dark brown, concealed surfaces on the limbs similar
and without any markings. Sides a little varied with the white of
the belt. A light border to the upper lip, and lighter line from the
orbit to the angle of the mouth; dermal scapular fold pale edged.
Femur and tibia with dark crossbands on the exposed surfaces."
We examined the holotype on 25 September 1969, and found it to
be soft and rubbed. The coloration remains much the same as
described by Cope, who provided no means of distinguishing
<i>planiceps</i> from <i>taurinus</i>. The coloration and morphometric and
structural characters of the type of <i>planiceps</i> all fall within the
range of variation displayed by series of <i>O. taurinus</i> from the upper
Amazon Basin.</p>

<p>The type of <i>Hyla vilarsi</i> is a gravid female having a snout-vent
length of 62.7 mm. The diameter of the tympanum is 4.8 mm, 73.8
percent of the diameter of the eye. The dorsal roofing bones of the
skull are moderately exostosed, and the lateral edges of the frontoparietals
are distinctly elevated. The skin on the dorsum is smooth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Melin (1941:42) described the coloration of the holotype as follows:
"Above uniform reddish brown; upper eyelids and sides of head
darkish brown; below the rostral edge a narrow dark band, continuing
as a broader light-edged one through the eye and tympanum
towards the base of the forelimb and then farther on continuing
along the sides as a line of black spots; sides of upper jaw whitish
with traces of dark cross bars (one distinct under the eye); sides of
body darkish with black spots and marble, often on a whitish
ground; thighs, tibiae, and tarsi each with two broad light-edged,
dark cross bars on a brownish ground (less distinct on thighs); sides
of thighs finely mottled with brown; beneath whitish with small,
sparse spots along jaw, on the chest and sides." We examined the
type on 17 February 1969, at which time the specimen was somewhat
desiccated, especially the hands and feet. The coloration remains
much the same as described by Melin, except that he failed
to note the presence of four elongate spots on the back.</p>

<p>The status of the names <i>Osteocephalus planiceps</i> Cope and <i>Hyla
vilarsi</i> Melin was confused by Cochran and Goin (1970:322), who
assigned these names to the synonymy of <i>O. leprieurii</i>. Bokermann
(1966:64) placed <i>Hyla vilarsi</i> in the synonymy of <i>Osteocephalus
taurinus</i> without justification. The type specimens of both <i>planiceps</i>
and <i>vilarsi</i> have moderately exostosed dermal roofing bones and
distinct cranial ridges. The type of <i>planiceps</i> has moderately large
tubercles on the dorsum, and the type of <i>vilarsi</i> has spots on the
throat, chest, and flanks and longitudinal markings on the back.
All of these features are characteristic of <i>taurinus</i> and not of
<i>leprieurii</i>, which lacks exostosis and cranial ridges and has transverse
markings on the back, no spots on the throat, chest, and flanks,
and in males has small dorsal tubercles.</p>

<p>The type of <i>Hyla depressa</i> is a male having a snout-vent length
of 69.8 mm. The diameter of the tympanum is 5.2 mm, 77.6 percent
of the diameter of the eye. The dorsal roofing bones of the skull
are moderately exostosed, and the lateral edges of the frontoparietals
are elevated. The skin on the dorsum is tuberculate. The
dorsum is dull brown with a broad darker brown longitudinal mark
having indistinct lateral edges from the snout to the post-sacral area.
A narrow cream middorsal line extends from the snout to the vent.
The side of the head is dark brown, palest posteroventral to the
orbit. The posterior surfaces of the thighs are dull brown; the
flanks are pale brown, and the ventral surfaces are pale creamy tan.
Dark brown transverse bars are present on the limbs. When we examined
the type on 3 January 1969, it was in excellent condition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Andersson (1945:75) contrasted the type of <i>Hyla depressa</i> with
<i>leprieurii</i> and <i>buckleyi</i>, but he did not compare his specimen with
<i>taurinus</i>, from which it exhibits no distinguishing features.</p>

<p><i>Osteocephalus taurinus</i> is a widespread and variable species,
and it has received several specific names. We are convinced that
<i>Osteocephalus taurinus</i> Steindachner, 1862, is the oldest available
name for this large Amazonian species. The following names are
junior synonyms: <i>Osteocephalus flavolineatus</i> Steindachner, 1862;
<i>Osteocephalus planiceps</i> Cope, 1874; <i>Hyla (Trachycephalus) vilarsi</i>
Melin, 1941; <i>Hyla depressa</i> Andersson, 1945.</p>

<p>The moderately rugose dorsum (in males), large size, extensive
webbing on the hand, and frontoparietal flanges in adults serve to
distinguish <i>taurinus</i> from other members of the genus.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;The Amazon Basin, the upper Orinoco Basin, and
the Guianas. Most localities are below 500 m, but the species ascends
the lower Amazonian slopes of the Andes to elevations of
about 1000 m (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig.&#160;11</a>). A record from Caracas, Venezuela, and
those from Provincia Carchi and Provincia Esmeraldas, Ecuador,
are considered to be erroneous. The latter specimens were included
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
in a collection sold to the University of Illinois; contained in the
collection are many common Amazonian species unknown from the
Pacific lowlands. 516 specimens from 151 localities.</p>

</div>
<br />

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This widespread species is highly variable in size and
coloration. Striking differences in snout-vent length are evident in
series from various parts of the range. The smallest calling males
(CAS-SU 12351-6 from Rio Tapirapé, Brasil) have snout-vent
lengths of 46.5-60.3 (mean 53.3) mm, whereas the largest (FMNH
140254, KU 92243-6, WCAB 9997, 10001, 10003-4 from Igarapé
Marmelo, Brasil) have snout-vent lengths of 71.5-84.6 (mean 77.6)
mm. Mean values of snout-vent lengths of males from other localities
are: Río Pastaza drainage, Ecuador 73.8 mm, Surinam 67.7
mm, Río Ucayali drainage, Perú 57.6 mm, and Guyana 55.5 mm.
Although the difference between the smallest and largest adults is
highly significant, populations bridging the gap do exist. Furthermore,
the geographic arrangement of small versus large frogs is a
confusing mosaic. We have entertained the thought that we have
included more than one species in <i>taurinus</i>, but on the basis of preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
specimens we are unable to detect consistent differences
distinguishing two or more taxa.</p>

<p>The coloration and pattern of <i>taurinus</i> are so variable that no one
series of statements can describe samples drawn from the entire
range of species. We have been unable to determine geographic
trends in color pattern; instead the variation within a given sample
can encompass the variety known in most other samples. Two minor
exceptions do exist. A narrow middorsal light stripe is present in
some individuals from throughout the range, but striped specimens
are most common in the upper Amazon Basin. The absence of
dorsal markings is uncommon in the entire species, but it is most
frequent in individuals from the Guianas. A few individuals, such
as KU 105230, have scattered white spots on the dorsum.</p>

<p>The coloration of four males in life from Lago Agrio, Ecuador
(KU 126652-5) was: "Dorsal ground color tan to dark brown with
darker brown markings. Flanks creamy tan to yellow with brown
or black flecks or mottling. Venter uniform creamy yellow or yellow
with brown spots or reticulations. Iris greenish yellow with radiating
black streaks and a median, horizontal reddish brown streak."
(W. E. Duellman, field notes, 12 May 1969.) A female from Santa
Cecilia, Ecuador (KU 123173), was: "Dorsum mottled olive-green
and tan. Flanks tan with brown spots. Belly and throat creamy
white, becoming tan posteriorly. Edge of upper jaw olive-green."
(W. E. Duellman, field notes, 16 June 1968.) Another female from
Santa Cecilia (KU 123175), was: "Brown dorsally with cream-colored
mottling. Transverse bars on legs darker brown with
cream-colored edges. Margin of upper lip creamy yellow. Anterior
and posterior surfaces of thighs tan. Flanks white with brown spots.
Venter creamy white. Iris greenish bronze with heavy radiating
reticulations of black." (W. E. Duellman, field notes, 22 July 1968.)</p>

<p>The tendency for females to have a labial stripe posteriorly and
the absence of dorsal tubercles in females has resulted in the identification
of many such specimens as <i>O. leprieurii</i>.</p>

<p>Ontogenetic change in coloration is slight in <i>taurinus</i>. Most
juveniles (less than 40 mm in snout-vent length) can be identified
readily. There is a tendency for the dorsal markings of juveniles to
consist of several small spots. Apparently with growth the spots
usually coalesce, forming a large median blotch, but some adults
retain the juvenile pattern. Cochran and Goin (1970:251)
erroneously identified several juveniles from Colombia as <i>Hyla
palpebrogranulata</i> Andersson.</p>

<i>Hyla verrucigera</i> Werner, 1901].</div>

<p><i>Justification of Synonymy.</i>&mdash;Trueb and Duellman (1970:605)
discussed the assignment of the names in the synonymy of <i>O.
verrucigerus</i>; only a brief resumé is given here.</p>

<p>The extant type of <i>Hyla verrucigera</i> is a juvenile male having a
snout-vent length of 32.0 mm. The dorsum is smooth except for
tubercles on the eyelids; the skin is loose, and the body is soft. The
specimen is faded to a pale brown; indistinct dark spots are present
on the back, and transverse bars are evident on the limbs.</p>

<p>The holotype of <i>Hyla riopastazae</i> is a gravid female having a
snout-vent length of 64.7 mm. The dorsum is smooth. The dorsal
ground color is pale brown with indistinct brown transverse bars
on the limbs. The throat, chest, and belly are cream with brown
spots and mottling.</p>

<p>The holotype of <i>Hyla orcesi</i> is an adult male having a snout-vent
length of 52.6 mm. The dorsum is heavily tuberculate. The dorsum
is dark brown with faint transverse bars on the forearms and feet;
the ventral surfaces are creamy brown.</p>

<p>Trueb and Duellman (1970) provided conclusive evidence that
the types of <i>H. verrucigera</i>, <i>riopastazae</i>, and <i>orcesi</i> are a juvenile,
adult female, and adult male, respectively, of one species, the
earliest available name for which is <i>Hyla verrucigera</i> Werner, 1901.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;1)&#160;Size moderate, sexual dimorphism evident; maximum
observed snout-vent length in males 54.3 mm, in females 65.8
mm; 2)&#160;skin on dorsum in males bearing large, keratinized tubercles;
3)&#160;skin on flanks smooth; 4)&#160;web extending to base of antepenultimate
phalange on inner edge of third finger; 5)&#160;dorsum uniformly
dark brown or black, with tan snout in females; 6)&#160;venter
creamy white, heavily mottled with black or dark brown, especially
in females; 7)&#160;lips marked with pale tan labial stripe and suborbital
bar; 8)&#160;flanks dull reddish brown; 9)&#160;dermal roofing bones of skull
lacking exostosis; 10)&#160;dermal sphenethmoid absent; 11)&#160;nasals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
widely separated medially; 12)&#160;anteromedial margin of frontoparietals
at anterior border of orbit; 13)&#160;frontoparietal fontanelle
covered; 14)&#160;palatine serrate; 15)&#160;parasphenoid bearing odontoids;
16)&#160;zygomatic ramus of squamosal extending approximately one-half
of distance to maxillary arch; 17)&#160;transverse processes of third
presacral vertebra approximately equal in width to sacral diapophyses;
transverse processes of presacral vertebrae 3-8 subequal
in width; 18)&#160;intermandibularis and submentalis muscles connected;
19)&#160;supramandibular portion of interhyoideus forming simple,
tubular, posterolateral extension; associated skin unmodified.</p>

<p><i>Osteocephalus verrucigerus</i> can be distinguished from other
members of the genus by its uniformly dark dorsum, heavily mottled
venter, and large, spinous tubercles on the dorsum in males.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Lower Amazonian slopes (500-1840 m) of the
Andes and on the western fringe of the Amazon Basin in Ecuador
and Perú; one locality (Acevedo) in upper Río Magdalena drainage
in Colombia (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig.&#160;9</a>). 40 specimens from 13 localities.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In life the dorsum in males is dull olive-green; the
groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs, inner surfaces
of limbs, and upper arms are dark brown. The ventral surfaces of
the limbs are pinkish tan; the other ventral surfaces are pale creamy
tan with reddish brown spots. The suborbital spot is pale greenish
tan, and the iris is deep reddish brown. In females the dorsum is
dull olive-brown; the anterior part of the head is tan, and the suborbital
spot is yellowish tan. The groin and hidden surfaces of the
limbs are dark reddish brown. The ventral surfaces of the limbs
are brown; the throat and chest are creamy white, and the belly is
reddish tan, both with dark brown mottling.</p>

<p>Considerable ontogenetic change occurs in coloration. Juveniles
are pale above with a dark median dorsal blotch and dark transverse
bars on the limbs. The venter is white. The change consists principally
of an increase in dark pigment and subsequent obliteration
of the juvenile pattern.</p>

<p>Tadpoles of this species have moderately long tails with low fins,
robust bodies, two rows of labial papillae with median part of the
upper lip bare, and two upper and five lower rows of teeth. Trueb
and Duellman (1970) described the eggs, tadpoles, mating call, and
variation in the adults.</p>
<br />

<div class="caption2">GENERIC RELATIONSHIPS</div>

<p>Among the 33 genera currently recognized in the family Hylidae,
there are two basic types of vocal sac structure (Duellman, 1970b),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
namely the subgular type and the lateral type. Only four hylid
genera, all Neotropical lowland groups, are known to possess paired
lateral vocal sacs; these are <i>Osteocephalus</i>, <i>Argenteohyla</i>, <i>Phrynohyas</i>,
and <i>Trachycephalus</i>. The geographical distributions and
morphological characteristics of these four genera suggest that they
are more closely related to one another than with any other hylid
genera.</p>

<p>Of the four genera, <i>Osteocephalus</i> is the most generalized in
morphology, and, like <i>Phrynohyas</i>, has no specialized habits. <i>Osteocephalus</i>
and <i>Argenteohyla</i> are similarly distinguished from
<i>Phrynohyas</i> and <i>Trachycephalus</i> on the basis of vocal sac structure.
The vocal sacs of <i>Osteocephalus</i> and <i>Argenteohyla</i> are posterior and
protrude posterolateral to the angles of the jaws when they are
inflated, whereas those of <i>Phrynohyas</i> and <i>Trachycephalus</i> are more
lateral and protrude posterior to the angles of the jaws when
inflated.</p>

<p>Although <i>Osteocephalus</i> and <i>Argenteohyla</i> have similar vocal sac
structure, they are obviously distinct. The monotypic <i>Argenteohyla</i>
is a rather specialized, semifossorial frog (Trueb, 1970b), characterized
by smooth skin, moderate-sized digital discs, and a large
inner metatarsal tubercle. The general architecture of the skull is
not unlike that of <i>Osteocephalus</i>; the skulls of both are well roofed,
broader than long, and characterized by posterolaterally oriented
parasphenoid alae. <i>Argenteohyla</i> bears small, slightly curved prevomerine
dentigerous processes in contrast to the large, angular
processes of <i>Osteocephalus</i>. The skull of <i>Argenteohyla</i> shows specializations,
apparently adaptations to its semifossorial mode of
existence, which further distinguish the genus from <i>Osteocephalus</i>.
In comparison with <i>Osteocephalus</i>, the cranium of <i>Argenteohyla</i> is
slightly depressed anteriorly, the roofing bones extensively casqued,
and the palatines robust.</p>

<p>Osteologically, <i>Osteocephalus</i> more closely resembles <i>Phrynohyas</i>
than either of the other two genera, but <i>Osteocephalus</i> and
<i>Phrynohyas</i> are clearly distinct on the basis of their respective vocal
sac structure. Like <i>Osteocephalus</i>, skulls of the members of the
genus <i>Phrynohyas</i> are broader than long, have extensive dermal
roofing bones, and have posterolaterally oriented parasphenoid alae.
In contrast to <i>Osteocephalus</i>, the dentigerous processes of the
prevomers are curved, rather than angular in <i>Phrynohyas</i>. Furthermore,
the latter genus is singularly distinguished from <i>Osteocephalus</i>,
<i>Argenteohyla</i>, and <i>Trachycephalus</i> by having extensively developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
parotoid glands that produce a viscous, milky volatile
secretion.</p>

<p><i>Trachycephalus</i> is the most readily identifiable of the four genera
under discussion. Members of this genus are large frogs with
heavily casqued and co-ossified skulls (Trueb, 1970a). The dermal
roofing bones bear ornate and characteristic patterns of sculpturing.
The medial ramus of the pterygoid does not articulate with the otic
capsule, and the parasphenoid alae are laterally, rather than posterolaterally,
oriented. A dermal sphenethmoid is present, and the
parasphenoid bears odontoids. The basic structure of the skull has
many characters in common with both <i>Osteocephalus</i> and <i>Phrynohyas</i>.
The obvious modifications of dermal roofing bones and of
palatal and suspensory elements seem to be specializations adapting
members of the genus <i>Trachycephalus</i> to their peculiar phragmotic
habits. The vocal sac structure of <i>Trachycephalus</i> is like that of
<i>Phrynohyas</i> and therefore further distinguishes it from <i>Osteocephalus</i>.</p>

<p>Morphologically, <i>Osteocephalus</i> seems to be sufficiently diverse
and generalized so as to represent a modern derivative of an ancestral
type which might have given rise to <i>Phrynohyas</i>, <i>Trachycephalus</i>,
and <i>Argenteohyla</i>. The specialized vocal sac structure
in <i>Phrynohyas</i> and <i>Trachycephalus</i> suggests that these two genera
may be rather closely allied and represent a single phyletic line
from an ancestral stock similar to <i>Osteocephalus</i>. <i>Argenteohyla</i> is
quite distinct from <i>Phrynohyas</i> and <i>Trachycephalus</i> and apparently
represents a distinct phyletic line from the ancestral stock.</p>
<br />

<div class="caption2">OCCURRENCE OF <i>OSTEOCEPHALUS</i> IN AMAZONIAN ECUADOR</div>

<p>All of our observations on members of this genus have been
made at four localities: 1)&#160;Santa Cecilia at an elevation of 340
meters on the Río Aguarico, a tributary of the Río Napo, 2)&#160;Lago
Agrio, 330 meters, about 14 kilometers east of Santa Cecilia, 3)
Puerto Libre, 570 meters, on the Río Aguarico just east of its formation
by the confluence of the Río Cofanes and Río Chingua, and
4)&#160;south slope of the Cordillera del Dué, above the Río Coca, 1150
meters. <i>Osteocephalus leprieurii</i> was found at all four localities,
and <i>buckleyi</i> was found at all but the last; <i>taurinus</i> was found at
Santa Cecilia and Lago Agrio, and <i>verrucigerus</i> was found only in
the Cordillera del Dué. Our data are based on collections of 113
frogs and three lots of tadpoles, as well as observations on calling
sites and young. The observations are summarized by species, as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<i>Osteocephalus buckleyi.</i>&mdash;No breeding activity was observed.
Males were found only at night in March, June, and July. One was
perched on a <i>Heliconia</i> leaf in a swamp at Puerto Libre, and two
were on bushes in the forest at Santa Cecilia. A gravid female was
found on a recently felled tree at Lago Agrio on the night of 12
May 1969.</p>

<p><i>Osteocephalus leprieurii.</i>&mdash;Males were heard calling sporadically
at Puerto Libre in July 1968, and at Santa Cecilia in May 1969.
A small chorus was found on the night of 12 May 1969 at Lago
Agrio, where the frogs were perched on branches of fallen trees
over a temporary pool. The call is a soft rattling chuckle. In late
April and May many gravid females and males with well-developed
nuptial excrescences were obtained from trees as they were felled
at Lago Agrio. The reproductive condition of the frogs indicates
that they probably breed in May. One individual called nearly
every night from a large tree at Puerto Libre between 4-17 July
1968. The tree was felled on the latter date, but no frog was found.
Two nights later apparently the same individual called from a
<ins title='Correction: was "bromeiad"'>bromeliad</ins> at a height of about 10 m on a large bamboo adjacent to
the felled tree; the frog was collected when the bamboo was cut
down.</p>

<p>Throughout the rainy months that we have worked in Ecuador
(April-August) we have found occasional individuals perched on
bushes or low trees at night. Large numbers of adults were observed
only during a clearing operation which resulted in the felling
of many large trees. Thus, it seems likely that <i>leprieurii</i> is a tree-top
inhabitant. A partially digested adult male was removed from the
stomach of a <i>Hemiphractus proboscideus</i>.</p>

<p>At Santa Cecilia many recently metamorphosed young and juveniles
were found in June and July 1968. Most of these were on
low bushes or herbs in swamp forest at night; some were found in
unfolded <i>Heliconia</i> leaves by day, and one was observed on the
forest floor by day. Snout-vent lengths of 18 specimens are 12.3-17.0
(mean 15.1) mm. The smaller frogs were recently metamorphosed
as evidenced by the melanophore deposits above the vent. The
coloration of the young is strikingly different from that of the adults
(see account of <i>O. leprieurii</i>), so the association of the young and
adults was not made until individuals with intermediate patterns
were obtained at Lago Agrio in May 1969. Probably juveniles obtained
in June and July are the offspring of an April or May breeding.
We have been unable to associate tadpoles with this species.</p>

<p><i>Osteocephalus taurinus.</i>&mdash;A small chorus occurred at Lago Agrio
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
on 12 May 1969. Males were calling from the ground adjacent to a
small pool amidst recently felled trees. The males were very wary
and, when approached, jumped onto limbs and ran up branches;
this behavior was noted by Bokermann (1964). The call consists
of a series of low-pitched, short notes&mdash;like a slow trill&mdash;four to six
notes per call group. Call groups are repeated two, three, or four
times followed by a lapse of several minutes. Although no amplectant
pairs were found, several gravid females were collected at Lago
Agrio in May, so it can be safely assumed that the species breeds in
May. From April through July occasional individuals were observed
on bushes and trees at night. During clearing operations at Lago
Agrio several individuals were obtained from the tops of trees as
they were felled.</p>

<p><i>Osteocephalus verrucigerus.</i>&mdash;Observations were made in a
broad, shallow ravine, in which there was a small stream. On 2-4
August 1968, males were observed calling from low bushes and
rocks at the edge of a quiet pool in the stream. The call consists of
a series of well-pulsed, low-pitched, guttural notes produced at the
rate of 5-10 per minute. One amplectant pair was found at the base
of a bush adjacent to the pool on 3 August. Another female was
found on a branch of a tree 2 m above the ground and 10 m from
the stream. Tadpoles of this species were found in the quiet silt-bottomed
pool.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
